This is mostly for me, but I figured I'd share it with whoever wants it. It uses xterm (as evidenced by the desktop file), tmux, zsh, oh-my-zsh, powerlevel10k, and more than a few vim plugins for some help with python, or just other general niceties. It's sort of bloated, but I like it.

Make sure you have fzf, grc, and thefuck before running `setup.sh`, or you'll get annoying messages telling you to install them (well, maybe not for grc, but I like that one).

to clone this thing, run:
`git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:Gnostiphage/.dotfiles.git`
this way the submodules from other repositories will actually be pulled as well
